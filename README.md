# Althea's Bookshelf

The purpose of this project is to create a website for fellow parents or guardians to share 
the most recommended books by their young ones. These could be the books that they always read to
their toddlers before bedtime or during story times. This will be an interesting place for parents
to share their recommendations as well as their experiences when reading for their young ones.  

My inspiration for this project is our 2 years old daughter who continuously amazed us everyday.
One of her favorite times of the day is when we read her story books. She has couple of favorite books
that she always chose especially before bedtime. She loves these books to the point that she has memorized
the lines from the characters.  

For this project, I will be using python, flask and MongoDB as my primary programming language and
html, CSS, JavaScript and materialize for the front end.

# UX

## Project Goals:

#### My goals for this project are:

*  Create an interactive website where parents/guardians and/or childminders can use it as a source of information
    on what books they should get for their young ones

* The website should give the site visitor ability to suggest a book they think their toddler loves,
    add a comment or feedback to other books posted by other users at the same time it should give
    them the ability to delete or remove their account if they wish to.

#### Site Owner's Goals:

* To provide a platform for the user to share books best fit for the young ones

* Create an interactive community working towards the goal of sharing the best books for the little ones.

## User Stories:

#### Target Audience:

Our target audiences are parents/guardians and childminders who are searching for a quality books to read to their kids.

* I should be able to remove/delete an account or books shared if this are not appropriate to the site's purpose.

## Design:

The aim of the site design is to ensure the focus is on the book reviews.
Icons used on the site are easy to understand and read and therefore text use is avoided where possible.

#### Fonts

I chose easy to read and light fonts for this app. I am keeping it simple and will only use one type of font:

#### Color Fonts

I opted for this color pallete since as per research this works better for toddlers.

#### Icons

On this project I have used easily identifiable Font Awesome icons.

## Wireframes

I designed my site moc-ups using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) wireframes.
The idea was to create a basic layout structure of the site and identify how it will display on different screen sizes.
